# PetClarityWebsite
This is the code for the PetClarity Website.
PetClarity is meant to be a webapp where people can ask questions and revisit information given from vetenary visits in a simple dashboard location. They have the ability to change languages and pets as needed.
No back end is implemented as it is just a simple front end prototype.
Uses fullcalendar.io and cometchat
